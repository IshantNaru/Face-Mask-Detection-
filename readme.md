# Face Mask Detection 
Ever since the strike of COVID-19, face masks have become a crucial part of our daily life. These are used to prevent the transmissions of any contagious microbes that cause infections such as the novel corona virus and other environmental contaminants such as air pollution, which can cause major health related problems and diseases. Many countries have/had made the use of face mask as a compulsory necessity for people commuiting and travelling outside their homes and have imposed penalties for not wearing one while being present in a social surrounding. 
<br/> Computer vision algorithms, such as the aforementioned Face-Mask Detection can help the authorities automate surveillence, for example detection of face mask present on a person's face in a public setting and prevent any further spread of the pandemic.

## About
The model uses face-detection pretrained network on top of binary-classification trained weights to give the final output in the form of color coded bounding boxes and probability of a person wearing a mask on their face.
